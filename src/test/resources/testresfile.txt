The way I work so hard for things they just take away from me.
Everything that they say about me.
And everything that they make me need,
are nothing when they're taking everything away from me.
Out on the streets - they're falling one by one
The cries of every nation they're fallin' on deaf ears again.
they are falling one by one.
